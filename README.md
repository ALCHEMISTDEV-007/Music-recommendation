# ðŸŽ¶ Music Recommendation System

Simple project that recommends songs using **TF-IDF** and **Cosine Similarity**.

## What is this?
- I used song titles and artists.
- I convert text into numbers with TF-IDF and find similar songs with cosine similarity.

## Files
- `notebooks/music_recommendation.ipynb` â€” the Colab notebook with code and plots.
- `datasets/songs.csv` â€” the dataset used.
- `requirements.txt` â€” Python libraries needed.

## How to run
1. Download the notebook and open in Colab or Jupyter.
2. Make sure `datasets/songs.csv` is in the same folder.
3. Install libs:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
